# Prepared CMF Data Structure

An observation in the prepared data is one establishment, and is uniquely identified by the variables file_name and firm_number, and schedule in the 1880 special schedules. The following table shows the number of variables and observations in each cleaned dataset:

### Variable Availability

In the following variable availability tables, checks indicate that the variables are available, stars indicate that specified variables can be constructed from available data, and dashes mark variables that are unknowable.

#### Manuscript Variables

The above table lists out variables original to the manuscripts, and their availability by year. Since there are many manuscript variables unique to 1880, those are ommitted in this table.

#### Constructed Variables

The above table lists out the constructed variables available in the prepared data. An important note is that there are no 1880 general schedule constructed variables that are unique.

#### Unique 1880 General Schedule variables

There are a number of unique variables in 1880 that have analogous variables or are constructable in other years.

#### 1880 Special Schedule Variables

There are 324 unique variables in the 1880 special schedules. The following .csv file shows the availability for each of those across each schedule.
