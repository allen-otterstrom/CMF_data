  <summary><strong>Where did the data come from?</strong></summary>
  The United States collected a census of manufacturers in the years 1850–1880. Similar to the Census of Population and the Census of Agriculture, this process involved sending numerous enumerators (U.S. Marshals and their assistants) to interview manufacturing establishments across the United States. Unlike the Census of Population, there were a few stipulations for what would be included. For example, the Census of Manufactures included only firms that produced goods worth at least $500. Some industries, like “butter, cheese, etc.” were included as home manufacturers on the agriculture census before being included in the manufacturing census more often until presumably complete coverage in 1880.

  <summary><strong>Why are there multiple 1880 datasets?</strong></summary>
  Establishments in 1850–1870 were all canvassed using the same questionnaire, although the exact questions varied by decade. In 1880, the Census of Manufactures was split into three parts, a general schedule, a "special agent" schedule, and a "special" schedule. Many types of firms were included in the general schedule and were given a questionnaire similar to those of decades past. Certain firms in industries deemed important were included in the "special agent" schedule, where someone knowledgeable about the particular industry performed the enumeration with a specially tailored set of questions. A third set of establishments appeared on the "special" schedule. These establishments also belonged to industries considered important and were canvassed with specific questions, but normal Marshals were used instead of experts. There are twelve industries that fall into this category, and thus 12 slightly different sets of questions.
