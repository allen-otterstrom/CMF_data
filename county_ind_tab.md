# County-Industry Tabulations

We have digitized manufacturing data, by county and industry, for 1860, 1870, and 1880 from the original published tabulations of the Census of Manufactures (United States Census Bureau, 1860b, 1870, 1880). In 1860, the Census of Manufactures also collected information for enterprises outside of manufacturing (fisheries and mining).

The county-industry data report many industries in each decade, with some small variations, which we concord for our analysis.  We homogenized industry names from each county to the list of industry names from US-industry tabulations in each decade:  331 names in 1880, 412 names in 1870, and 639 names in 1860 (for a total of over 1100 distinct names).  We then grouped these industries into 193 categories that were more consistent across decades, and further grouped these industries into 31 categories. Starting in 1870, the county-by-industry data do not list some “neighborhood industries” such as blacksmithing (Atack and Margo, 2019) or additional industries with less than $10,000 of revenue in total. We also created an “other” industry, representing less than 1% of revenue, reflecting named but small industries not otherwise classified.
