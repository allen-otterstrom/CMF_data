## About the Data

This project assembles and harmonizes historical manufacturing data from the Census of Manufactures, utilizing all surviving manuscript schedules from 1850-1880.  
The resulting datasets enable researchers to analyze industrial change, geographic patterns, and firm dynamics throughout the mid-19th century in the United States.

- Track the geographic spread of manufacturing industries.
- Compare establishment-level and county-level economic patterns.
- Study the effects of transportation, energy, and policy on industrial growth.
- Link micro-level CMF records to other historical datasets.
