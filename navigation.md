# Census of Manufactures Image Navigation

This section describes the structure of a CMF manuscript. This is done using the 1850 manuscript, but is similar for the 1860, 1870, and 1880 General Schedule manuscripts. Here is the entire example image:

<div>
  <img src="{{ '/assets/images/1850_NAV.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="1850 Navigation">
</div>

The very top contains information about the location of the establishments listed, including State, County and Township.

<div>
  <img src="{{ '/assets/images/nav_1.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Nav 1">
</div>

The next section contains column headers that describe the various pieces of information that the Census Marshal obtained from the establishment. These are the source of the original variables available in the Census of Manufacturer's microdata.

<div>
  <img src="{{ '/assets/images/nav_2.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Nav 2">
</div>

Below this, each establishment's information was recorded in rows and in columns. A single establishment can occupy more than one row since one establishment might have many materials it takes in, power it uses, and products it creates.

<div>
  <img src="{{ '/assets/images/nav_3.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Nav 3">
</div>

This is the basic format of the 1850-1880 general schedule manuscripts. The special schedule manuscripts differ in their format. The following example is of special schedules 3 and 4, boots/shoes and leather.

<div>
  <img src="{{ '/assets/images/1880_NAV.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="1880 Navigation">
</div>

At the very top of the manuscript it is stated which special schedules it includes.

<div>
  <img src="{{ '/assets/images/nav_4.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Nav 4">
</div>

Right under, the location of the establishments included on the manuscript is recorded.

<div>
  <img src="{{ '/assets/images/nav_5.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Nav 5">
</div>

There are two sections on the manuscripts for special schedules 3-12. Here we have Boots and Shoes and Leather.

<div>
  <img src="{{ '/assets/images/nav_6.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Nav 6">
</div>

<div>
  <img src="{{ '/assets/images/nav_7.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Nav 7">
</div>

There are many more columns in these manuscripts than in the general one, and are tailored to the specific industry.

<div>
  <img src="{{ '/assets/images/nav_8.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Nav 8">
</div>

<div>
  <img src="{{ '/assets/images/nav_9.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Nav 9">
</div>

In these special schedules establishments usually take up one line across the two sections.
